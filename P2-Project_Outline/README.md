## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The law firm I work for books heavy travel, which naturally includes the cancellation of flights. Air travel credits are offered when refunds are not available. Unfortunately, travel credits can be forgotten about before they are used. It is a reality for my firm and many other companies. This app will track employee air travel credits so as to avoid this loss.

TL;DR: This app helps companies limit hits to their bottom line by tracking the usage and expiration of employee air travel credits.

### Initial Features aka #gottahaveit
- User accounts: Regular users (employees who book or use travel)
- Create credits: Users will input the appropriate information for any new travel credits, including but not limited to: Original date purchased, date cancelled, airline, confirmation number, expiration date
- Edit credits: Users can update a credit when it is partially used.
- List of air credits will be sortable by columns (date purchased, airline, amount, etc). I kind of feel like this one is a given so it may not need to be listed at all.
- Regular reminders: App will send timely reminders at regular intervals up until expiration of the credit. This will default to every 30 days but frequency is customizable by users. (Pop-up or email??)

### BONUS FEATURES - These seem like features that would be ideal for companies
- Admin accounts: Those in the accounting department who track employee expense reports
- Shared access: Users can choose to share their info (travel credits) with other users. This is best for attorneys who share travel booking with their legal assistants.

### BONUS BONUS FEATURES aka #mywishlist
- Chrome web extension
- Firefox add-on

### Technologies
- Java
- Spring Boot
- MySQL
- Gradle...?

### What I'll Have to Learn
I'm sure there is much more that I will need to learn. I am not sure exactly everything that I should be using or whether this project idea is feasible.
I will need to learn how to make admin accounts that have wider access than regular user accounts.
I need to learn how to share access (editable as well) between accounts and their content.
I need to learn how to create an automatic pop-up or reminder at given date intervals.
